Researchers have worked to make CNN models deeper and deeper over the past years in an effort to gain higher accuracy in predictions.

The backpropagation algorithm makes a small change to each weight in such a way that the loss of the model decreases. Using the chain rule, we can find this gradient for each weight. But, as this gradient keeps flowing backwards to the initial layers, this value keeps getting multiplied by each local gradient. Hence, the gradient becomes smaller and smaller, making the updates to the initial layers very small, increasing the training time considerably.\n",

In an attempt to decrease the variance of an extra tree, we're going to use a technique called 'Bootstrap Aggregating' (often abbreviated 'bagging'). This stems from the idea that a collection of weak learners can learn decision boundaries as well as a strong learner. This is commonly called a Random Forest.\n",

Let's randomly pick some features (65% percent of features) and grow the tree based on the pre-determined randomly selected features. Therefore, there is no need to find random features in each split.\n",

    "## 3.3 Plotting Feature Importance [5pts Bonus for All] <span style=\"color:green\">**[W]**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "While building tree-based models, it's common to quantify how well splitting on a particular feature in an extra tree helps with predicting the target label in a dataset. Machine learning practicioners typically use \"Gini importance\", or the (normalized) total reduction in entropy brought by that feature to evaluate how important that feature is for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini importance is typically calculated as the reduction in entropy from reaching a split in an extra tree weighted by the probability of reaching that split in the extra tree. Sklearn internally computes the probability for reaching a split by finding the total number of samples that reaches it during the training phase divided by the total number of samples in the dataset. This weighted value is our feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what this metric means with an example. A high probabiity of reaching a split on feature A in an extra tree trained on a dataset (many samples will reach this split for a decision) and a large reduction in entropy from splitting on feature A will result in a high feature importance value for feature A. This could mean feature A is a very important feature for predicting the probability of the target label. On the other hand, a low probability of reaching a split on feature B in an extra tree and a low reduction in entropy from splitting on feature B will result in a low feature importance value. This could mean feature B is not a very informative feature for predicting the target label. **Thus, the higher the feature importance value, the more important the feature is to predicting the target label.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, fitting a sklearn.ExtraTreeClassifier to a dataset auomatically computes the Gini importance for every feature in the extra tree and stores these values in a **feature\\_importances\\_** variable. [Review the docs for more details on how to access this variable](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier.feature_importances_)\n",
